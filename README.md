# Iris Flower Classification Model

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project repository! This machine learning model is crafted to classify iris flowers into three types based on their sepal and petal width and length. The project involves data collection using the Iris Flower dataset, data cleaning with Pandas, numerical computations with NumPy, visualizations using Matplotlib, preprocessing, and model building using SKLearn. GridSearchCV is employed to find the best model with optimal hyperparameters.

## Model Overview

### Data Collection and Cleaning

- **Iris Flower Dataset:**
  - The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Iris Flower dataset.
  - Leveraged Pandas for data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

- **NumPy Computations:**
  - Utilized NumPy for numerical computations and manipulations on the dataset.

### Data Visualization

- **Matplotlib Visualization:**
  - Employed Matplotlib for visualizing data distributions, correlations, and insights.
  - Visualized relationships between features, class distributions, and other relevant patterns.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Conducted feature engineering to create meaningful features from the available data.
  - Handled any outliers and standardized numerical features.

### Model Building

- **SKLearn Classification Model:**
  - Employed SKLearn for building a classification model to predict iris flower types.
  - Utilized GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters and identify the best model.

### Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy Metrics:**
  - Model performance evaluated using accuracy metrics to measure its effectiveness in classifying iris flowers.

## Project Usage

1. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`iris_flower_classification.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the classification model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Make Predictions:**
   - Input sepal and petal width and length to classify iris flowers into their respective types.

## Note

This Iris Flower Classification model demonstrates the application of a classification algorithm to predict iris flower types based on sepal and petal dimensions. The use of GridSearchCV ensures the selection of optimal hyperparameters for improved model performance.
